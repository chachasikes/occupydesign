### Git Repository ###

https://github.com/chachasikes/occupydesign

PREFERRED: This is a git repository. 
This is a tool for tracking changes, and also publishing files
and support materials.

* If you have a github account, you can edit text in the repository
  from the github website.
* If you would like to be added, please contact the OccupyDesign group.


#### About this repository ####
We have tried to organize this repository in a way that will support
distributed, social design. We use folders to manage the files.

Each directory has a sample folder, that should give you an idea of how
to save your files, and how to name them. Saving your files in a consistent
way will help us to post images to the website in a more timely manner -
and keep track of versions.

## Dropbox ##

We have a public dropbox for working files.
This is mainly to support real-time collaboration.

** 2GB limit! **

* The whole git repository is in the Dropbox Public folder.


The git repo is included in the dropbox public folder.
The Dropbox folder is mainly for design assets (website docroot would preferably be another git repo.)

The idea is that one can checkout the git repo, or download the zip file from github. 
Anyone in a collaboration setting can be added to dropbox to work on the same folder
in situations where people do not know how to use git.

Anyone who knows git would be able to commit changes if they are added 
to the repo if they have a github account. This will help with managing versions.

### File Formats ###

We want everyone to be able to be able to mix, match and mashup vector images
to communicate and express their opinions with visual clarity.

We encourage you to share files in formats that everyone can use. 

SVG - for vectors graphics
PNG - for web images with transparency
JPG - high quality photos when available
PDF - for Illustrator files for compatibility with older versions of Illustrator
      and other editing programs.
PSD - for Photoshop files, again, consider older versions of the program.


#### Working with vector images ####

If you want to mix and match vector images and make signs, you will probably
want a vector editing program. Adobe Illustrator, or free tools like
Inkscape, Aviary's Raven, and Google Drawing.

Remember to save your images as SVG whenever possible, organize & label layers,
and merge messy paths. Icons can be scaled to be very large or very small, so
doing what you can to help this will help others to also make icons.

### About OccupyDesign ###

Occupy Design is a grassroots project connecting designers with on-the-ground
demonstrators in the Occupy Together movement. The project’s goal is to create
freely available visual tools around a common graphic language to unite the 99%.
The project places an emphasis on producing infographics and icons to improve the
communication of the movement’s messages and the data surrounding them across the world. 

The site includes a showcase of existing designs, a how-to guide for demonstrators,
a graphic toolkit for designers, and a platform for the community to suggest ideas 
for designs. The project was created in less than 24 hours October 14-15 weekend by 
a team of designers, programmers, artists, and demonstrators in San Francisco as part 
of three concurrent creative hackathons across the country to support Occupy Together.

As part of their planning process, team members spoke with demonstrators from Occupy
San Francisco, who gave pointed insight into their on-the-ground needs, and reiterated 
the value of well-designed, universal signage. The project focuses on three main areas – 
infographic protest signs to bring data visualization to the street; logistical signs to 
streamline occupations; and a set of custom-designed, open-source visual icons around 
social justice themes. The focus on infographics stemmed from the desire to bring graphic 
representation of statistical evidence to the forefront of the movement on the ground – 
rather than being limited to independent computer screens.
